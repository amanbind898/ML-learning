## 📝 Learning Notes

### Key Concepts Mastered
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data (features → target)
- **Regression vs Classification**: Predicting numbers vs categories
- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes training data, fails on new data
- **Validation**: Testing model performance on unseen data

### Best Practices Learned
- Always split data before training
- Use meaningful evaluation metrics (MAE for regression, accuracy for classification)
- Start simple, then add complexity
- Document and comment code thoroughly
